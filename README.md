üöó Bengaluru Parking Meters ‚Äì A Case Study
Level of Difficulty: Medium
 Inspired by: Wharton Casebook (Chicago Parking Meters)
 Topics Covered: Market sizing, mathematical estimation, cost-benefit analysis, innovation strategy, and strategic thinking.

üìò Case Background
The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) is considering leasing the rights to manage and collect revenues from all street parking meters in the city to a private operator for a period of 20 years. This is part of BBMP‚Äôs effort to streamline parking operations, raise upfront capital, and offload operational burdens.
In exchange for a one-time lump-sum payment, the winning bidder will manage the parking meter infrastructure, collect usage fees, and upgrade the system with smart meters that support UPI, credit/debit cards, mobile wallets, and more.
Note: Any penalties or fines issued (for illegal parking, overstay, etc.) will still go to BBMP, not the private operator.

üéØ Objective
You‚Äôve been hired by a private company named "ParkSmart India", which is planning to participate in BBMP's competitive bid. Your consulting team is expected to:
Estimate a fair price ParkSmart should offer for the rights to Bengaluru's parking meters for 20 years.


Analyze revenue, costs, and risks.


Recommend operational and strategic enhancements to stay competitive.



üî¢ Step-by-Step Framework
1Ô∏è‚É£ Revenue Estimation
a. Meter Distribution (Urban Zones)
Zone
Location
Price per hour (‚Çπ)
% of Meters
Daily Usage
I
Central Bengaluru (MG Road, Koramangala)
‚Çπ50
5%
12 hrs/day
II
Business Hubs (Whitefield, Jayanagar, Indiranagar)
‚Çπ30
25%
8 hrs/day
III
Outer Zones/Suburbs (Hebbal, HSR Layout, Rajajinagar)
‚Çπ15
70%
4 hrs/day

Assume Bengaluru has around 60,000 metered parking spaces.
b. Usage Assumptions
Uniform usage 30 days/month, 12 months/year


No seasonal fluctuation (for simplicity)


No growth in usage (zero growth rate for base scenario)


c. Annual Revenue
Zone-wise calculation:
Zone I: 5% of 60,000 = 3,000 meters
 ‚Çπ50 x 12 hrs x 30 x 12 x 3,000 = ‚Çπ648,000,000


Zone II: 25% of 60,000 = 15,000 meters
 ‚Çπ30 x 8 hrs x 30 x 12 x 15,000 = ‚Çπ1,296,000,000


Zone III: 70% of 60,000 = 42,000 meters
 ‚Çπ15 x 4 hrs x 30 x 12 x 42,000 = ‚Çπ1,134,000,000


Total Annual Revenue = ‚Çπ3,078,000,000
 20-Year Revenue = ‚Çπ61,560,000,000

2Ô∏è‚É£ Cost Estimation
a. One-Time Setup Costs
Assume 1 smart meter can serve 8 spots ‚Üí 60,000 / 8 = 7,500 meters
 Cost per smart meter = ‚Çπ10 lakh
 Total CapEx = ‚Çπ750 crores
b. Recurring Operational Costs
Staff: 1 person per 80 spots ‚Üí 750 people


Wage: ‚Çπ20,000/month ‚Üí ‚Çπ1.8 crore/month ‚Üí ‚Çπ21.6 crore/year


Maintenance: ‚Çπ2,000/meter/month ‚Üí ‚Çπ1.8 crore/month ‚Üí ‚Çπ21.6 crore/year


Total Recurring Cost/year = ‚Çπ43.2 crore
 20-Year Recurring Costs = ‚Çπ864 crore
 Total Cost (20 years) = ‚Çπ750 + ‚Çπ864 = ‚Çπ1,614 crore

3Ô∏è‚É£ Profit & Bid Estimate
Total Revenue (20 years): ‚Çπ6,156 crore
 Total Cost (20 years): ‚Çπ1,614 crore
 Net Cash Flow: ‚Çπ4,542 crore
Assuming ParkSmart wants to offer a competitive bid with a healthy margin and leave some buffer for risks, it could bid around ‚Çπ3,000‚Äì‚Çπ3,200 crore upfront.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Creative Strategy Suggestions
a. Revenue Boost Ideas

Weather-proof infrastructure to avoid Bengaluru rain-related malfunctions


Behavioral shift: Encourage digital payment habit via reward points or discounts



‚úÖ Summary Recommendation
Suggested Bid Price: ‚Çπ3,000‚Äì‚Çπ3,200 crore
 Rationale: Balanced profit margin with contingency buffer over a ‚Çπ6,156 crore potential revenue
 Key Drivers of Success: High uptime meters, user-friendly tech, efficient workforce, and adaptable pricing.
